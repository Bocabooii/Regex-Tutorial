## Regex Components

### Anchors

Regex anchors are special characters used to match positions within a string, rather than matching actual characters. They do not consume any characters during the matching process. Anchors are essential for specifying where a pattern should occur in a text. The two most common anchors are:

^ (caret) - The caret symbol is the start-of-line anchor. It is used to match the beginning of a string. For example, the regex ^abc would match the string "abc" only if it appears at the beginning of the text.

$ (dollar sign) - The dollar sign is the end-of-line anchor. It is used to match the end of a string. For example, the regex abc$ would match the string "abc" only if it appears at the end of the text.

Here are some examples to illustrate how anchors work:

^hello matches "hello world" but not "world hello."
world$ matches "hello world" but not "world hello."
^hello$ matches "hello" exactly.

### Quantifiers

'?' (Question Mark): The question mark is a quantifier that makes the preceding character or group optional. In this regex, (https?:\/\/)? means that the "http://" or "https://" part is optional in the URL.

'+ (Plus): The plus sign is a quantifier that matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character or group. For example, [\da-z\.-]+ means matching one or more alphanumeric characters, dots, or hyphens in the subdomain part of the URL.'

{2,6} (Curly Braces): The curly braces indicate a range quantifier. In this case, [a-z\.]{2,6} means matching a sequence of lowercase letters and dots, with a length between 2 and 6 characters. This is used to match the top-level domain (TLD) like ".com," ".org," etc.

'* (Asterisk): The asterisk is a quantifier that matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character or group. For example, ([\/\w \.-]*)* means matching zero or more occurrences of characters like slashes, alphanumeric characters, spaces, dots, or hyphens in the path of the URL.'

Each of these quantifiers helps define the flexibility and structure of the URL pattern. The regex allows variations in the URL, such as optional "http://" or "https://" prefixes, subdomains, and varying path segments. However, it's important to note that this regex may not cover all possible URL formats and may not be a complete solution for URL validation. URL parsing and validation can be complex, and in some cases, it's better to use specialized libraries or tools for URL handling.
